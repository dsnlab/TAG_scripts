# The BBL image processing umbrella

**Important Note: we are in the process of transitioning to use FMRIPREP for initial preprocessing steps. The documentation is being actively updated and may be outdated in places. If you run into an inconsistency or something is unclear please post an issue on github!**

##### Overview

xcpEngine provides a configurable, modular,
agnostic, and multimodal platform for neuroimage processing and quality
assessment. It implements a number of high-performance denoising approaches and
computes regional and voxelwise values of interest for each modality. The
system provides tools for calculating functional connectivity after preprocessing
has been run in `FMRIPREP`, as well as a standard toolkit for benchmarking pipeline
performance. All pipelines from [our
2017 benchmarking paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302591) are
implementable, as are the pipelines evaluated in [the recent work of Parkes and
colleagues](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/05/156380).

##### Documentation

Detailed documentation is accessible at the [pipeline's documentation
hub](http://pipedocs.github.io).

If you experience any difficulties, we suggest that you search or post to the
issues forum of the pipeline's GitHub repository.
