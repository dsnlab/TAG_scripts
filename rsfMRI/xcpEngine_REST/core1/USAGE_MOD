Usage for pipeline module:
<module_name>.mod -d <design> <options>

Compulsory arguments:
 -d : Localised design file for pipeline:
      Includes all specifications for processing routines
      to be run as part of the current pipeline. Use the
      localiser to localise it to all subjects. (Localisation
      is automatically completed by the pipeline Engine.)
 -c : Context in pipeline:
      Input should be a positive integer that denotes
      the overall position of the module in the
      analytic pipeline.

Optional arguments:
 -t : Trace status:
      Integer value ( 0 - 3 ) that indicates the level
      of verbosity during module execution. Higher
      levels reduce readability but provide useful
      information for troubleshooting.
      0  [default]: Human-readable explanations of
         processing steps and error traces only.
      1: Explicitly trace module-level computations.
         Print a workflow map when execution completes.
      2: Explicitly trace module- and utility-level
         computations.
      3: All commands called by the module and all
         children are traced and explicitly replicated
         in a log file. This log file can then be used
         to debug output.
