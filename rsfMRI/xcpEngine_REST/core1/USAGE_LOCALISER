Usage for pipeline localiser:
xcpLocaliser -d <design> <options>

Compulsory arguments:
 -d : Design file for pipeline:
      Includes all specifications for processing routines
      to be run as part of the current pipeline.
 -o : Output superdirectory:
      A path to the top-level output directory in which
      all processed subject directories will be written.
 -s : Subject index and cohort:
      Input should be (1) a positive integer that denotes
      the internal index of the subject data that are to
      be localised and (2) the path to the cohort file
      for the current analysis, delimited by a colon in
      the format 1:2 .

Optional arguments:
 -i : Scratch space:
      Some systems operate more efficiently when temporary
      files are written in a dedicated scratch space. This
      argument enables a scratch space for intermediates.
 -t : Trace status:
      Integer value ( 0 - 3 ) that indicates the level
      of verbosity during module execution. Higher
      levels reduce readability but provide useful
      information for troubleshooting.
      0  [default]: Human-readable explanations of
         processing steps and error traces only.
      1: Explicitly trace module-level computations.
         Print a workflow map when execution completes.
      2: Explicitly trace module- and utility-level
         computations.
      3: All commands called by the module and all
         children are traced and explicitly replicated
         in a log file. This log file can then be used
         to debug output.
